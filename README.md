# AirBNB-Booking-Database-Design-and-Management


## Description
AirBNB is a rental and hospitality website that is used all over the world in more than 191 countries for short-term lodging such as vacations. The company that was founded in 2008 has a lot of customers who rent the houses of the hosts who put up their houses on rent.

The purpose of this project is to design and develop the database of AirBNB to dig deeper into learning how complex a hospitality enterprise database can be. AirBNB has revolutionized lodging and travelling and it can serve as a blueprint for a lot of other industries which function on the principle of renting instead of ownership. This business model is the future and it will be intriguing to learn about the data that the AirBNB needs to store in their database so that it is used in meaningful ways to best serve the people associated with the enterprise.
